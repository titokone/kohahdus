<h1>SUMMARY OF THE TTK-91 INSTRUCTION SET</h1>
<i>This document is also available in <a href="ttk91_ref_fi.html">finnish</a></i>

<p>In the symbolic machine language, the commands are of following form:</p>

<pre>
LABEL OPER Rj,M ADDR(Ri)

where  OPER    the symbolic name of the command
       Rj      the first operand (register R0..R7)
       M       addressing mode:
               =   immediate operand
                   direct addressing (empty, ie. not marked)
               @   indirect addressing
       ADDR    address part (memory address or immediate value)
       Ri      possible index register (register R0..R7)        
</pre>

<p>If some part of the instruction is not significant, it can be left out.
It is possible to add a label (symbolic address) in front of a command. The 
label may contain letters A-Ö, numbers 0-9 and an underscore _. The label
must contain at least one non-numerical character. Only the first 8 characters
are significant.</p>

Almost all commands have the following forms available:
<pre>
  OPER Rj,ADDR        direct memory addressing
  OPER Rj,Ri          direct register addressing
  OPER Rj,=ADDR       immediate operand
  OPER Rj,@ADDR       indirect memory addressing
  OPER Rj,@Ri         indirect memory addressing
  OPER Rj,ADDR(Ri)    indexed addressing
  OPER Rj,=ADDR(Ri)   indexed immediate operand
  OPER Rj,@ADDR(Ri)   indexed indirect memory addressing      
</pre>

<h2>Compiler control instructions (fake instructions)</h2>

<p>The compiler control instructions give instructions to the assembler's
compiler. They ARE NOT actual instructions of the assembler.<br><br></p>

<p>label <b>EQU </b>value</p>
<p class="indent">The equation instruction EQU defines an integer value to a symbolic
label. The label can be used in an instruction's ADDR-field, after which it
will be handled like a "value" typed in the same place.<br><br></p>

<p>label <b>DC</b> value</p>
<p class="indent">Memory allocation instruction DC (data constant) reserves one memory
word for a constant, equates the address of the allocated memory cell and
the symbolic address "label" and sets the number "value" as the contents
of the reserved memory cell. The label can be used in an instruction's
ADDR-field like a memory address.<br><br></p>

<p>label <b>DS</b> size</p>
<p class="indent">The data reservation instruction DS (data segment) allocates a memory
block of specified size (in words) and equates the starting address
of the allocated memory cell and the symbolic address "label". Is used for
allocating space for global variables. A label can be used in an instruction's
ADDR-field like a memory address.<br><br></p>

<p>option <b>DEF</b> string <i>(not available in TitoTrainer)</i></p>
<p class="indent">This special instruction changes options for simulating
the file system of a TTK-91 machine. 'String' should be an absolute directory 
path. Examples:<pre>
  STDIN DEF /home/myuser/ttk91/stdin
  STDOUT DEF C:\mydir\stdout
</pre>
<p class="indent">Available options are:</p>
<table>
<tr><td class="term">STDIN</td>
<td>To set which file stdin data is read from (default is file <tt>stdin</tt> in the user's current working directory)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="term">STODUT</td>
<td>To set which file stdout data is written to (default is file <tt>stdout</tt> in the user's current working directory)</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="indent"><i>The DEF instruction is disabled in TitoTrainer for security reasons</i></p>






<h2>Addressing modes</h2>
<h3>Immediate Operand</h3>
<p>In immediate addressing the second operand is a constant embedded in the 
instruction word. Immediate operand is a signed 16-bit integer so the range of
possible values is -32768...32767.</p>
Example:<pre>
1) LOAD R1, =100        Load the number 100 to register R1.</pre>

<h3>Direct Addressing</h3>
<p>Direct addressing is a scheme in which the address specifies which
memory word or register contains the operand.</p>
Examples:<pre>
2) LOAD R1, 100         Load the content of memory address 100 to register R1.
3) LOAD R1, R2          Load the content of register R2 to register R1.</pre>

<h3>Indirect Addressing</h3>
<p>Indirect addressing is a scheme in which the address specifies which memory
word or register contains not the operand but the address of the operand.</p>
Examples:<pre>
4) LOAD R1, @100        Load the content of memory address stored at
                        memory address 100 to the register R1.
5) LOAD R1, @R2         Load the content of the memory address stored at
                        register R2 to register R1.
</pre>

<h3>Indexed Addressing</h3>
<p>Addresses have two parts: the number of an index register and a constant.
The address of the operand is the sum of the constant and the contents of
the index register. It contains indexed (direct) addressing, indexed
immediate addressing and indexed indirect addressing.</p>

Examples:<pre>
6) LOAD R1, 100(R2)     Load the content of the memory address which is 
                        the sum of 100 and the content of register R2 to
                        register R1.
7) LOAD R1, =100(R2)    Load the sum of 100 and the value of register R2
                        to register R1.
8) LOAD R1, @100(R2)    Load the content of the memory address stored at
                        the memory address which is the sum of 100 and 
                        the number in register R2 to the register R1.
</pre>

<h3>Hardware addressing modes</h3>
<p>It is worth noting that in actuality the TTK-91 instruction set
has only three adressing modes instead of the eight presented above.
In compiled code all adressing uses indexing and constants. Although 
you can omit the index register or the constant from your assembly
code, the compiler automatically adds them to the compiled binary.
For example:</p>

<pre>
"LOAD R1, =10"  ==  "LOAD R1, =10(R0)"
"LOAD R1, R2"   ==  "LOAD R1, =0(R2)"
"LOAD R1, @R2"  ==  "LOAD R1, 0(R2)"
"LOAD R1, @10"  ==  "LOAD R1, @10(R0)"
"LOAD R1, 10"   ==  "LOAD R1, 10(R0)"
</pre>

<p>In the above examples, note the use of register R0. When used as index
register, the value of R0 is always zero. You can assign other values
to R0 and perform ALU operations on it, but when used in the second
operand it is always treated as zero. When used as the <i>first</i>
operand R0 behaves like any other register. For example consider the
failed attempt to copy R0 with LOAD, and the workaround to this limitation:  </p>

<pre>
a) LOAD R3, R0          Assign 0 to R3, regardless of the value of R0.

b) STORE R0, X          Store the value of R0 to memory location X
   LOAD R3, X           Load the value of memory location X to R3
</pre>
